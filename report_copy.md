## Implementation Details

### Programming Concepts from Course Used:

#### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
**How Used:** Data models in Kotlin demonstrate inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Classes like `Assembly`, `UserData`, and `Dimensions` implement Parcelable interface for Android data transfer.

**Location:** `src/Android/src/main/java/com/magic/trackflow/data/model/Models.kt`

#### 2. Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture
**How Used:** Express.js backend separates concerns with controllers handling business logic, middleware managing cross-cutting concerns, and routes defining API endpoints.

**Location:** `src/Web_part/Backend/src/controllers/`, `src/Web_part/Backend/src/middleware/`, `src/Web_part/Backend/src/routes.js`

#### 3. Database Design and Relationships
**How Used:** PostgreSQL schema implements foreign keys, constraints, and relational integrity. Tables are normalized with proper relationships between projects, assemblies, users, and supporting entities.

**Location:** `src/Supabase_queries/SQL_Migrations/`

#### 4. Authentication and Authorization
**How Used:** JWT tokens for web authentication, NFC card validation for mobile users, role-based access control with admin/manager/worker permissions.

**Location:** `src/Web_part/Backend/src/middleware/auth.js`, `src/Web_part/Backend/src/middleware/mobileAuth.js`

#### 5. RESTful API Design
**How Used:** HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) map to CRUD operations, proper status codes, and resource-based URL structure.

**Location:** `src/Web_part/Backend/src/routes.js`

#### 6. Error Handling and Validation
**How Used:** Express-validator middleware for input validation, custom error types, and centralized error handling middleware.

**Location:** `src/Web_part/Backend/src/middleware/validation.js`, `src/Web_part/Backend/src/utils/errorHandler.js`

#### 7. Asynchronous Programming
**How Used:** Promises and async/await for database operations, file uploads, and API calls. Event-driven architecture for real-time updates.

**Location:** Throughout controller files and API clients

#### 8. State Management
**How Used:** React hooks for frontend state, Android ViewModels for mobile state, and PostgreSQL for persistent state.

**Location:** `src/Web_part/FrontEnd/src/pages/`, `src/Android/src/main/java/com/magic/trackflow/ui/screens/`

### Other Notes:
The implementation demonstrates enterprise-level software engineering practices including security by design, scalable architecture, and cross-platform compatibility. The use of TypeScript enhances code reliability through static typing.

1. **Monolithic Web Application**
   - **Pros:** Simple deployment, easier initial development
   - **Cons:** Limited scalability, poor mobile support, single point of failure

2. **Microservices Architecture**  
   - **Pros:** Ultimate scalability, fault tolerance, independent deployment
   - **Cons:** Complex infrastructure, over-engineering for current scope

3. **Modular Service-Oriented Design (Selected)**
   - **Pros:** Balanced complexity and functionality, supports multiple platforms, maintainable
   - **Cons:** More complex than monolithic, requires careful API design

**Decision Rationale:**
Selected modular design because it provides optimal balance between development complexity and system capabilities. The manufacturing environment requires both web dashboard for management and mobile app for floor workers, making multi-platform support essential. The modular approach allows independent development of web and mobile components while maintaining data consistency.

### How Extension Affected Design

**Quality Control Extension Impact:**
- Required new database tables for QC images and notes
- Added file upload middleware and storage management
- Expanded mobile app capabilities beyond simple status updates
- Implemented additional authentication flows for QC operations

**Logistics Extension Impact:**  
- Introduced batch management system with new data models
- Required complex barcode relationships (assembly + batch barcodes)
- Added shipping coordination workflows
- Expanded API surface area significantly

**Mobile Platform Extension:**
- Necessitated parallel API development (web vs mobile endpoints)
- Required NFC hardware integration and authentication flows
- Added camera integration for barcode scanning
- Implemented offline capability considerations

### Test Description

**Testing Strategy:**
- **Unit Testing:** Individual function validation (controllers, utilities, data models)
- **Integration Testing:** API endpoint testing with database transactions
- **End-to-End Testing:** Complete workflow validation from mobile scan to web dashboard
- **Security Testing:** Authentication, authorization, and input validation
- **Performance Testing:** Concurrent user load and database query optimization

**Equivalence Classes Tested:**
- **Valid/Invalid Data Inputs:** Projects with complete vs incomplete data
- **User Role Permissions:** Admin, manager, worker access levels  
- **Device Authentication:** Valid/invalid NFC cards, active/inactive states
- **File Operations:** Supported/unsupported file formats and sizes

**Key Test Results:**
- 11/14 black-box test cases pass completely
- Role-based security functions correctly
- Real-time status updates work across platforms
- Areas needing improvement: password validation, reporting, performance monitoring

### Lessons Learned

**Programming Concepts:**
1. **API Design Principles** - RESTful design with proper HTTP methods and status codes
2. **Security by Design** - Multi-layer authentication and authorization from project start
3. **Database Relationships** - Complex foreign key relationships require careful constraint design
4. **Cross-Platform Development** - Maintaining data consistency across web and mobile platforms
5. **Error Handling** - Centralized error management improves debugging and user experience

**Software Process:**
1. **Iterative Development** - Requirements evolved significantly, requiring flexible architecture
2. **Documentation Importance** - Complex system requires comprehensive API documentation
3. **Testing Integration** - Early testing integration prevents major refactoring later
4. **Version Control** - Branching strategy essential for multi-developer team coordination
5. **Deployment Considerations** - Production environment differs significantly from development

### Functionalities to Demo

**Core Workflow Demonstration:**
1. **Project Creation** (Web Dashboard)
   - Create new project with client, timeline, and specifications
   - Upload technical drawings and documentation
   - Add assemblies with weights, dimensions, and specifications

2. **Mobile Authentication** (Android App)
   - NFC card scan for worker authentication
   - Display user profile and permissions
   - Access appropriate functionality based on role

3. **Assembly Tracking** (Mobile → Web)
   - Scan assembly barcode on mobile device
   - Update status in real-time (Waiting → In Production → Welding → Painting → Completed)
   - Show immediate status change on web dashboard

4. **Quality Control Process** (Mobile App)
   - Authenticate with NFC card for QC operations  
   - Scan assembly barcode to load details
   - Capture and upload inspection photos
   - Add QC notes and approval status
   - View results on web dashboard

5. **Logistics Coordination** (Mobile App)
   - Scan batch barcode for shipping preparation
   - Add/remove assemblies from shipping batches
   - Coordinate with logistics team through batch management

**Security Features Demo:**
- Role-based access control (worker cannot create projects)
- NFC card deactivation preventing unauthorized access
- Session management and token expiration
