## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project is a **production tracking system** designed to improve workflow visibility and efficiency. It allows real-time monitoring of the production process by tracking:  
- **Current, completed, and upcoming tasks** within a project.  
- **Deadlines** to ensure timely completion.  
- **Employee assignments**, including who worked on each task (e.g., assemblers, welders, painters).  
- **Client information**, linking projects to specific customers.  
- **Part tracking via barcodes**, where each part is assigned a unique barcode that workers scan to update its status.  

The system helps streamline production by providing a clear overview of progress, responsibilities, and deadlines, ensuring that all stages are efficiently managed.
