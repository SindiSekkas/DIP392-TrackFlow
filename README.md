# **DIP392-TrackFlow**  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project is a **production tracking system** designed to improve workflow visibility and efficiency. It allows real-time monitoring of the production process by tracking:  
- **Projects and assemblies**: Manage projects with multiple assemblies, their specifications, and manufacturing status.
- **Deadlines and timelines**: Track start dates, end dates, and delivery dates to ensure timely completion.
- **Employee assignments**: Manage workers with different roles (e.g., assemblers, welders, painters).
- **Client information**: Maintain a database of clients linked to specific projects.
- **Barcode scanning**: Each assembly is assigned a unique barcode that workers can scan to update its status.
- **NFC card authentication**: Workers can use NFC cards to authenticate and record actions in the system.
- **Drawing management**: Upload and manage technical drawings for projects and assemblies.

The system helps streamline production by providing a clear overview of progress, responsibilities, and deadlines, ensuring that all stages are efficiently managed.
